/*
The scheme of synchronization is easy: (i use system 5)
There are 3 semaphore: wantWrite,readWorking and writeWorking (last like mutex, and the first two are counter in fact)

READER:
If more than one read-funx(like search) need to read data it  will be wait until wantWrite!=0.
ATOMICALLY it add at readWorking +1, to start only if no one write are current at working.
After, ALL READER-funx can be work and finally decrease readWorking counter (this in concurrency).

WRITER:
to start it  add wantWrite +1, (to signal at new reader, it si necessary to waiting)
after the writers WAIT until all reader just at work finish.
then, writer-funx can lock writeWorking to write one at time (is a mutex),
enter in critic section, and at the end unlock writeWorking.
Finally decrement wantWrite -1, and finish.
